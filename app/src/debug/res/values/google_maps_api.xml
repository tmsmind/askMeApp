    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=B7:2A:26:18:66:E8:36:C9:82:36:B6:E4:7E:2D:85:48:C2:96:CE:03%3Bhumesis.apps.humesisdirectionapp

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    B7:2A:26:18:66:E8:36:C9:82:36:B6:E4:7E:2D:85:48:C2:96:CE:03;humesis.apps.humesisdirectionapp

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
